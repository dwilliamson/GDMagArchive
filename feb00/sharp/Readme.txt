This demo contains the source for the butterfly executable, a precompiled binary, and a couple different .net files, which are the arguments to the program. This demo requires GLUT (see below). 

This demo may not compile on your system on MSVC version 4.2 or 5.0 or 6.0 or whatever, I'm not too surprised; I haven't tested it on many systems. If this happens, you can send me email about it and I'll try to help if possible. 

If you get an error about some unbound or unavailable function in the GLUT DLL, you have an old version of GLUT. You need GLUT 3.7, available at http://www.opengl.org/Documentation/GLUT.html.
