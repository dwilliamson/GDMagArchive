This zip archive contains the code and instructions associated with Rob Wyatt's article in the May 1998 issue of Game Developer, "Building An Inline Performance Monitoring System." 

Each of the zip files within the Wyatt.zip archive (Listings.zip, GDPerfVXD_Win95.zip, GDPerfTest.zip, bin.zip, GDPerfCheck.zip, GDPerfSYS_WinNT.zip) should be unpacked to separate folders.  Consult the installation directions in Wyatt.zip for more detailed information.  

Important: read the article before experimenting with these utilities.  There is a real possibility that you could crash your system given the low-level nature of this performance monitoring system if you are using an AMD or other non-Intel processor.
