Here are the controls for this program:

    Left and Right arrows:  flip forward and backward through images.
    'F': toggle fillscreen mode
    Up and Down arrows: When in fillscreen mode, raise or lower
         mipmap resolution.
    Spacebar: When in fillscreen mode, toggle between an integer
         box filter and a Kaiser filter.
    '1'-'4': When in fillscreen mode, switch between the various
         available filters.
    'G': Draw graphs (you can reproduce all the graphs in the
         article but you have to do it by uncommenting various
         lines in the source code).
