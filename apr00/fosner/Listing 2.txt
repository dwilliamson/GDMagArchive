Listing 2. Process of generating and rendering a cubic environment map in pseudocode.

1. Prior to rendering the scene, render the cube map.
2. If the cube map dimensions are small, enable antialiasing for the cube rendering.
3. Set the viewport to the cube dimensions.
4. Set the perspective matrix to a 90-degree field of view for both the X and Y axes. 
5. For all six faces of the cube map:
	a. Set the render target to the current face.
	b. Optionally swap the Z-buffer to this map.
	c. Set the viewpoint LOOK and UP vectors as follows for the particular pass: 
		Cube face	LOOK Direction	UP Direction
		0	positive X		positive Y 
		1	negative X		positive Y 
		2	positive Y		negative Z 
		3	negative Y		positive Z 
		4	positive Z		positive Y 
		5	negative Z		positive Y 
	e. Set the modelview matrix according to LOOK and UP vectors centered at 	cube center.
	f. Begin scene.
	g. Render everything in the scene but this object.
	h. End scene.
6. Restore render target.
7. Reset viewport and all matrices.
