Ingame_Wood.mp3
This track demonstrates my intention to create a 
gripping musical atmosphere without using the whole 
orchestra. The piece of music uses a maximum of five 
instruments at the same time, which - for an orchestral 
score - is rather poor :-). Even so, it succeeds to 
provoke the desired effect in the final game.

Ingame_Khorinis.mp3
Ingame_Khorinis_Raw.mp3

Using real instruments like the guitar in this sample 
has a very positive effect on the music's authentic 
sound. I recorded four different mono guitar patterns 
(two of them demonstrated in the file 
Ingame_Khorinis_Raw.mp3) and mixed them together. Due 
to the limited memory I had to add most of the real 
instruments as mono samples. Fortunately, they come 
to life through the reverb quite well. The ocean sounds 
are not part of the original music, I mixed them in to 
simulate what the game player hears when taking a 
stroll around the block in the harbor district.

Ingame_Maya.mp3

The maya temple demanded a bunch of special samples 
(like the flute jingles) to sound distinctive. I 
added the birds and insects to demonstrate the 
overall atmosphere. They are not part of the original 
music.

Ingame_Transitions.mp3

This track demonstrates the use of our interactive 
music system to provide seamless transitions. The 
transition is triggered at 1:06min, leading to the 
fight theme. I used the "fill" transition type for 
this purpose. The "break" transition at 1:37min 
leads back to the default theme.

Also in this sample you can hear the general structure 
of our interactive music. As described in the article, 
the music consists of a multitude of patterns that are 
strung together in real-time. I'm sure you can determine 
when the one pattern ends and the next starts. 
Here's a list:

Default I:	0:00 min to 0:10 min
Default II: 	0:10 min to 0:28 min
Default III:	0:28 min to 0:38 min
Default IV: 	0:38 min to 0:47 min
Default I:	0:47 min to 0:57 min
Default V:	0:57 min to 1:06 min

T_Fill:		1:06 min to 1:08 min
Fight I:	1:08 min to 1:18 min
Fight II:	1:18 min to 1:28 min
Fight III:	1:28 min to 1:37 min

T_Break:	1:37 min to 1:40 min
Default I:	1:40 min to end...

Cutscene_Returninghome.mp3
Cutscene_Potpourri.mp3
Credits.mp3

I have used a different orchestra for the cutscenes, as 
compared to the ingame music, I was not bound to 
performance and memory limits. These tracks use up to 
100 samples at the same time, which would certainly have 
caused a breakdown of the interactive music system.
