This month we chop the Stanford bunny in half, then
stitch together the halves and build LODs for them.

Most of the keyboard controls are documented on the
screen.  In addition to those, you can use W,A,S,D
to move around.

This month we are demoing only one clip plane.  Next
month we'll clip something by a whole bunch of planes
and talk about how to stitch it back together under
those circumstances.
