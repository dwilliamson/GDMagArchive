This is the current particle system I've built for Oxygen3D, which is a work in progress. (It isn't fully consistent, optimized and perfect yet.) It will, however, help you build your own advanced particle system. This source code isn't a compilable program yet.  

I will also release a particle demo very soon, which will demonstrate all the particle systems included in my source code now.

Be sure to check out my homepage at www.mysticgd.com.

If you have any questions or whatever, email me.

Have fun!
