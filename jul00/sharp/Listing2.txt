"Go with the Flow: Improving Fluid Rendering Using Implicit Surfaces"
Game Developer magazine
July 2000 issue.


Listing 2. Pseudocode to polygonize an implicit surface inside a single cubelet.

polygonizeCubelet(vertices[8])
{
  unsigned char config = 0
  for n = 0 to 7
  {
    if vertex[n] is outside the surface
      set bit n of config to 1
    (otherwise leave it as 0)
  } 
    
    for each edge in edgesNeedingVertices[config]
    linearly interpolate to find the vertex on that edge
      
    for each triplet of triangle indices in triIndices[config]
    create a new triangle from those indices using the
    new linearly interpolated edge vertices
}
