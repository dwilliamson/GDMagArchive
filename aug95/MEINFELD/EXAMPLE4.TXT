Example 4: Common TinyMUSH Commands


say <text>

Enable the user to “speak aloud” to a group of people sharing the same 
location as the typist. If the user was named Shadow, the results would 
be:

Shadow types: say I have ants in my pants!
Shadow sees:  You say “I have ants in my pants!”
Everyone else sees: Shadow says “I have ants in my pants!”


move <exit name>

Will transport the user through the exit named if, and only if, the exit 
exists, and is not locked against the player trying to move through it.

@teleport <object> = <location> | <location> 

@teleport, when used with just the location, will teleport the user to 
that location, if the user own that room, or the room is set JUMP_OK, 
and the room is not teleport-locked against that player.


pose <text>

Enables the user to affect an action, or strike a pose.  The tricky part 
is typing the text in using the third person.  It comes with practice!  
Again, if Shadow uses it the results would be:

Shadow types: pose jumps about trying to lose the ants!
Shadow sees: Shadow jumps about trying to lose the ants!
Everyone sees: Shadow jumps about trying to lose the ants!

In this case both Shadow and everyone see the same thing.  Think about 
it -- there is no other easy way to handle this.


page <player>=<text>

This allows two people who do not share the same room to communicate.  
As usual, we’ll watch Shadow and learn:

Shadow types: page Alaric=Hey, where are you?
Shadow sees:  You paged Alaric with “Hey, where are you?”
Alaric sees: Shadow pages: Hey, where are you?


whisper <player>=<text>

Enables the typist to secretly speak to another player in the same room. 
Again, let’s watch Shadow:

Shadow types: whisper Alaric=So-n-so can be such a ween.
Shadow sees:  You whisper “So-n-so can be such a ween.” to Alaric.
Alaric sees:  Shadow whispers “So-n-so can be such a ween.”


WHO [<A-Z>]

Will show all the players on-line currently.  For popular MUDs, with 
many players, a single letter can be supplied to receive only the 
players whose names begin with that letter.

Shadow types:  WHO F
Shadow sees:

Player Name        On For Idle   Doing
Firsa               02:11  14m   Not much.
Fluff               03:30   0s   Graduating.
Fire                04:08  11s
Frog                06:12   6m   Hanging out on my pad.
Felan               06:57  12m   Destroying players.
39 Players logged in.

help [<topic>]

This command accesses the on-line help facility for TinyMUSH. Due to the 
large size of the text files, many of the older entries are out of date, 
or just wrong. Still, the majority is right, and there is no excuse for 
not reading at least some of the help.
