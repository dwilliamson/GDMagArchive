Listing 11: The structure of the in-game hash table from command.h, and a
sample entry from command.c

typedef struct cmdentry CMDENT;
  struct cmdentry {
      char *cmdname;
      NAMETAB *switches;
      int perms;
      int extra;
      int callseq;
      void (*handler) ();
  };

NAMETAB, defined in htab.h, is list of switches that modify the command
behavior. Rather than sending text to an object, a message could be sent to
an object’s contents with the use of /contents on the @pemit command.

typedef struct name_table NAMETAB;
  struct name_table {
      char *name;
      int minlen;
      int perm;
      int flag;
  };

Example CMDENT entries from command.c:

For the command, @pemit, which sends text to an object, in the form:
@pemit <object>=<text>.  The command:

      @pemit The Statue=The pigeons are coming!

Would send the text, “The pigeons are coming!” to the object named “The
Statue.”

{
        (char *) “@pemit”, 
        pemit_sw, 
        CA_NO_GUEST | CA_NO_SLAVE,
        PEMIT_PEMIT, 
        CS_TWO_ARG | CS_INTERP,
        do_pemit
},

The switches are:

NAMETAB pemit_sw[] =
{
    {(char *) “contents”, 1, CA_PUBLIC, PEMIT_CONTENTS},
    {(char *) “list”, 1, CA_PUBLIC, PEMIT_LIST | SW_MULTIPLE},
    {(char *) “object”, 1, CA_PUBLIC, 0},
    {NULL, 0, 0, 0}
};
