Example 8: Example of a look on TooMUSH

The Office Park Plaza
You stand in a bright, sunny plaza, just south of the huge Too Corp office
   building. Nearby, a large marble fountain with water gushing up to great
   heights, creates a fine mist that is refreshing in the mid-day sun.
As you look at the ominous Too Corp Tower, you get a bad feeling. Perhaps it is
   a passing cloud, or maybe that soda you drank earlier ... Or, maybe it is
   the fact that you know that within the stately office building, some of the
   most powerful wizards in all the world live and work. Who knows what dark
   vulgar obscene things these too-powerful beings are up to? Another chill.
   Best not to think of such things -- it is a pleasant, sunny day after all.
