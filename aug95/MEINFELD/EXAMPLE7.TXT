Example 7: @edit, a command that does not evaluate arguements

Below, when the user sets an ofail attribute, a typo is made.  Instead of %n, %%n 
is used, which will evaluate to %n, rather than the enacting playerÕs name. The 
command, @edit can rectify this.

> @ofail me=tries to grab Tangent! Tangent deftly trips %%n, foiling %p plans.
Set.

If Shadow tried to get Tangent, and Tangent was locked against Shadow, 
everyone in the room would see:

Shadow tries to grab Tangent! Tangent deftly trips %n, foiling his plans.

> @edit me/ofail=%%n,%n
Set - Ofail: tries to grab Tangent! Tangent deftly trips %n, foiling %p plans.

Now everyone will see the correct text:

Shadow tries to grab Tangent! Tangent deftly trips Shadow, foiling his plans.


The typo is fixed, but only because @edit does not evaluate the two arguements. 
If @edit did evaluate, the command would be, after evaluation, Ò@edit 
me/ofail=%n,TangentÓ. Notice that the command to set the ofail attribute also doe 
not evaluate its arguem!
 ent.  Most commands, like say, do:

> say %n and %%n
You say ÒTangent and %%nÓ
