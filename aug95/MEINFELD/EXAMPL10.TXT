Example 10: The TinyMUSH switch function.

Syntax:
switch(<target>,<case1>,<val1>[,...,<caseN>,<valN>][,<default-val>])

Switch, like all functions, takes text strings for arguments and returns a text
string as a result. The result returned is the value following the first case that
matches the target value, or the default, in the case of no matches.It can be used 
with commands like say:

> say switch(Ice,Ice,It’s cold.,Lava,It’s Hot.,Ice,Ice is still cold.)
You say “It’s cold.”

Evaluation of other function, %-substitutions does occur inside the switch() 
function. 
When a character named Tangent executes the following example, he sees:

> say switch(Tangent,%n,name(me),You are not Tangent. You are: %n.)
You say “Tangent”

However, when Alaric attempts the same thing:

> say switch(Tangent,%n,name(me),You are not Tangent. You are: %n.)
You say “You are not Tangent. You are: Alaric.”

Above, %n evaluates to the enactor’s name. The enactor is the player who 
triggered
the command, causing the function to evaluate. Also, name(me) is a way, via
a function, of the name of the of the object executing the command (not 
neccessarily
always the same thing).
