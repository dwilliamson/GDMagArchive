      dbref owner;              /* PLAYER: domain number + class + moreflags */
                                   /* THING, ROOM, EXIT: owning player number */
      FLAG flags;               /* ALL: Flags set on the object */
      FLAG flags2;              /* ALL: even more flags */
  };

These are system-dependent defines, found in autoconf.h:

typedef int  dbref;
typedef int  FLAG;
