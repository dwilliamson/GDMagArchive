Example 11: Sticky rooms in TinyMUSH

Players are like young children, leaving their things all about creating
an awful mess. A sticky room is one way to prevent this. After the last player
leaves the room, all the objects not linked to that room, are transported to
where the sticky room is linked.

After the player moves to the closet, the messy pile of clothes is moved.
Since the completion of move occurs after the move, the contents are not
shown until after the player types “look” Now, Too Heaven is 
self-cleaning, every house-keeper’s dream.
