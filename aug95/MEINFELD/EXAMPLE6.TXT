Example 6: An example of exit creation in TinyMUSH

@open A Gaurded Cave;cave;n;north=#0
@lock cave=#0
@fail cave=You bravely venture forth to the cave, but the gaurds block 
your path.
@ofail cave=boldly strides up to the cave, but gaurds block %p way!
@afail cave=@switch rand(4)=0,@pemit/contents %l=A group of bums laugh 
at %n!

Alaric and Tangent are both in the same room.  Alaric uses the
newly-created north exit.  Alaric sees:

> north
You bravely venture forth to the cave, but the gaurds block your path.
A group of bums laugh at Alaric!

When Alaric attempts to leave the room, Tangent sees:

Alaric boldly strides up to the cave, but gaurds block his way!
A group of bums laugh at Alaric!
