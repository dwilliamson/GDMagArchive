This program is pretty simple; it records the mouse pointer's position
in a vector, and updates history information for that vector each
frame.  The history is drawn on the screen, in the form of a linear
trail of average positions, and ellipses that represent variances.

Controls:
    'S': Toggle frame rate slowdown.
