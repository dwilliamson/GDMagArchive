There are two different source trees contained in this
month's sample code.

The first one is in the "terrain" folder.  It contains
a terrain renderer, like we have seen in previous 
installments.  The difference is that this one uses
the Seam Database to generate seams between chunks.
Because everything else is like the earlier terrain
systems, it can be a good introduction to seeing
how the seam database works.

The second source tree is in the "soup" folder.  It
applies the Seam Database to the job of maintaining
manifolds for an arbitrarily chopped-up triangle soup.

Each of these folders has its own README.txt, which
you may wish to see!
