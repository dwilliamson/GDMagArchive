This month's source code consists of some toy game worlds.
Press '1', '2', and '3' to switch between the games.

Game 1 (Dance Dance Revolution clone):
    Press the arrow keys to attempt to hit the moving targets.

Game 2 (RTS Mortar): 
    Control the target with the mouse.

Game 3 (Thief):
    Control the thief with the mouse.


The scripting language portions of each game are in the "data"
subdirectory; they are called "script1", "script2" and "script3".

The C++ code is not very heavily commented; I ran out of time, sorry!
There is a reasonable density of comments in the scripting language
portions, though.
