PLIB was written by Steve Baker, with help from
numerous others.  Special mention must go to:

  Daryll Strauss (GLIDE port to Linux)
  David Bucciarelli (Mesa -> GLIDE interface)
  Brian Paul (Mesa)
  Curtis Olson  (FlightGear guru and all-round "Mr Nice Guy")
  Vasily Lewis (Tireless maintainer and sysadmin at Woodsoup)
  Everyone at OPENGL-GAMEDEV-L and 3Dfx.glide.linux

Specific contributions came from:

  Ton Knienieder
    -- Ported SL to a bunch of non-Linux OS's

  Simon Britnell <ughbash@yahoo.com>
    -- Added SSG methods for searching for
       objects by name, etc.
    -- Added an SSG loader for the Me3D file format.

  Toru Egashira <toru@jms.jeton.or.jp>
    -- Who wrote a program called 'NSPmod' which was
       the original basis of the SL 'MOD' player -
       although the original code has been almost
       entirely rewritten in the process of merging
       it with SL.
