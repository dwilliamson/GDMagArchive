README.TXT for Voxel Demo
by Andre' LaMothe


****Instructions****

There are 3 versions of the Voxel engine:

VOXELWN1.EXE - Windows 95/DirectX 320x240 page flipped
VOXELWN2.EXE - Windows 95/DirectX 640x480 double buffered
VOXELD32.EXE - Dos 32 Protected Mode 320x256 double buffered

To fly around:

Controls:

<ESC>       - Exit.
<UP>        - Faster.
<DOWN>      - Slower.
<RIGHT>     - Turn Right.
<LEFT>      - Turn Left.
<A>         - Increase Altitude.
<Z>         - Decrease Altitude.
<PAGE UP>   - Pitch Up.
<PAGE DOWN> - Pitch Down.

Note: there is an autopilot that will engage if you leave
      the controls for a minute or so.

****Changing The Height Data****

The voxel engine can take different height and color
data. This is accomplished thru the command line.

The command line looks like this:

VOXEL(WN1|WN2|D32).EXE height_data_file.bmp color_data_file.bmp

* Both files must be on the command line.
* Both file names must be in 8.3 format.
* Files must be in 512x512 in 256 colors.
* Files must be .BMP with no compression.

****Generating Height Data****

The engine uses standard color encoded height data
such as generated by VistaPro.
