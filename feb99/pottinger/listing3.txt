Set all units' internal group movement priorities to the same low priority value.
Set state to cStateForming.
While state is cStateForming:
   {
   Find the unfilled position that's closest to the center of the formation.
   If no unit was available
      Set the state to cStateFormed and break out of forming loop.

   Select a unit to fill that slot using a game specific heuristic that:
      Minimizes the distance the unit has to travel.
      Will collide with the fewest number of other formation members.
      Has the lowest overall travel time.

   Set unit's movement priority to a medium priority value.
   Wait (across multiple game updates) until unit is in position.
   Set unit's movement priority to highest possible value.  This ensures that
      subsequently formed units will not dislodge this unit.
   }
