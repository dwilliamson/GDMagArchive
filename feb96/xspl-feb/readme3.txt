This archive contains Macintosh and Windows source code for the
XSplat library appearing in the February/March '96 issue.

To build this library under Windows (32-bit), you must link with
winmm.lib.

Because of trademark restrictions, only the XSplat library is
included and not the game discussed in the article. A new demo
that uses the XSplat library will be available soon.
